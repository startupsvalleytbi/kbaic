            <h2 class="title">Blockchain Technology</h2>
            <h5 class="description" align="justify">A blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, which are 
                linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, 
                and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree).

                By design, a blockchain is resistant to modification of the data. It is "an open, distributed ledger that can 
                record transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way". For use as a 
                distributed ledger, a blockchain is typically managed by a peer-to-peer network collectively adhering to a protocol for inter-node communication and validating new blocks. Once recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without alteration of all subsequent blocks, which requires consensus of the network majority. Although blockchain records are not unalterable, blockchains may be considered secure by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine fault tolerance. Decentralized consensus has therefore been claimed with a blockchain.

                Blockchain was invented by a person (or group of people) using the name Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 to serve as the public transaction ledger of the cryptocurrency bitcoin. The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto is unknown. The invention of the blockchain for bitcoin made it the first digital currency to solve the double-spending problem without the need of a trusted authority or central server. The bitcoin design has inspired other applications, and blockchains which are readable by the public are widely used by cryptocurrencies. Blockchain is considered a type of payment rail. Private blockchains have been proposed for business use. Sources such as Computerworld called the marketing of such blockchains without a proper security model "snake oil".</h5>

                <p>Most cryptocurrencies use blockchain technology to record transactions. For example,the bitcoin network and Ethereum network are both based on blockchain. On 8 May 2018 Facebook confirmed that it is opening a new blockchain group which will be headed by David Marcus who previously was in charge of Messenger. According to The Verge Facebook is planning to launch its own cryptocurrency for facilitating payments on the platform.</p>

                <p>Blockchain-based smart contracts are proposed contracts that could be partially or fully executed or enforced without human interaction. One of the main objectives of a smart contract is automated escrow. An IMF staff discussion reported that smart contracts based on blockchain technology might reduce moral hazards and optimize the use of contracts in general. But "no viable smart contract systems have yet emerged." Due to the lack of widespread use their legal status is unclear.</p>

                <h4 class="info-title">Blockchain with video games</h4>
                <p>Some video games are based on blockchain technology. The first such game, Huntercoin, was released in February 2014. Another blockchain game is CryptoKitties, launched in November 2017. The game made headlines in December 2017 when a cryptokitty character - an-in game virtual pet - was sold for US$100,000. CryptoKitties illustrated scalability problems for games on Ethereum when it created significant congestion on the Ethereum network with about 30% of all Ethereum transactions being for the game.

                Cryptokitties also demonstrated how blockchains can be used to catalog game assets (digital assets).

                The Blockchain Game Alliance was formed in September 2018 to explore alternative uses of blockchains in video gaming with support of Ubisoft and Fig, among others.</p>

                <h4 class="info-title">Supply chain</h4>
                <p>There are a number of efforts and industry organizations working to employ blockchains in supply chain logistics and supply chain management. The Blockchain in Transport Alliance (BiTA) works to develop open standards for supply chains. Everledger is one of the inaugural clients of IBM's blockchain-based tracking service. Walmart and IBM are running a trial to use a blockchain-backed system for supply chain monitoring — all nodes of the blockchain are administered by Walmart and are located on the IBM cloud. Hyperledger Grid develops open components for blockchain supply chain solutions. </p>

                <h4 class="info-title">Other uses</h4>
                <p>Blockchain technology can be used to create a permanent, public, transparent ledger system for compiling data on sales, tracking digital use and payments to content creators, such as wireless users or musicians. In 2017, IBM partnered with ASCAP and PRS for Music to adopt blockchain technology in music distribution. Imogen Heap's Mycelia service has also been proposed as blockchain-based alternative "that gives artists more control over how their songs and associated data circulate among fans and other musicians."

                New distribution methods are available for the insurance industry such as peer-to-peer insurance, parametric insurance and microinsurance following the adoption of blockchain. The sharing economy and IoT are also set to benefit from blockchains because they involve many collaborating peers. Online voting is another application of the blockchain.

                <ul>Other designs include:</ul>
                <li>Hyperledger is a cross-industry collaborative effort from the Linux Foundation to support blockchain-based distributed ledgers, with projects under this initiative including Hyperledger Burrow (by Monax) and Hyperledger Fabric (spearheaded by IBM)</li>
                <li>Quorum – a permissionable private blockchain by JPMorgan Chase with private storage, used for contract applications
                Tezos, decentralized voting.</li>
                <li>Proof of Existence is an online service that verifies the existence of computer files as of a specific time</p></li>
